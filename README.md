## About

Automation Tasks are one of the many new features of Alfred 5, [which is currently in Early Access](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/getting-started/early-access/). For the time being you need this Workflow to install and update them. By Alfred 5’s General Release, the process will be automatic.

Run `updateat` to bring your local copy of Automation Tasks up-to-date.
